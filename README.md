>[!NOTE]
>Just a small personal note and a small gag per say, this program is written in clean C and has no errors or warnings. The program was run and precompiled into an `.exe` with the following bash command:

```bash
$ sudo gcc -ansi -Wpedantic -Wextra -Wall main.c -o exe
```

This project showcases and more importantly explains a simple example of Singly Linked List.
